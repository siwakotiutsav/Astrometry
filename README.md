# Astrometry
In this repository, I will upload codes that are some basic astrometry like measuring, stuffs or some plots that i want or might have to repeat although excitation diagrams and such will have their own repo, something simple like split color bar, simple matplotlib plotting style that i want to use consistently and stuff like that will be kept here
