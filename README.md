# Astrometry

This repository is a collection of small, reusable utilities that I often need when working with astronomical data. Instead of rewriting the same snippets across multiple projects, I’m gathering them here as a lightweight toolbox for everyday tasks.

The goal of this repo is **simplicity and reusability**. Larger, project‑specific analyses (e.g., excitation diagrams, full pipelines, paper‑ready figure scripts) will live in their own dedicated repositories. This one focuses on the small but essential pieces that make analysis faster and more consistent.

## What’s in this repository

### 🛰️ Astrometry Utilities
Small scripts for:
- Measuring positions  
- Handling WCS metadata  
- Converting between coordinate systems  
- Quick checks and sanity tests on FITS headers  

### 🎨 Plotting Helpers
Reusable Matplotlib tools, including:
- Split / dual colorbar examples  
- Consistent plotting styles for astronomy figures  
- WCS‑aware plotting templates  
- Overlays (circles, contours, apertures, etc.)  
- Simple figure layouts I use frequently  

### 🧰 Convenience Functions
Anything that I find myself reusing across projects:
- Small wrappers  
- Utility functions  
- Quick‑start templates  
- Notebook snippets  

These are intentionally lightweight and easy to adapt.

## What’s *not* in this repository

This repo is **not** meant for full scientific workflows. The following will be kept in separate repos:
- Excitation diagrams  
- JWST/MIRI analysis pipelines  
- Full figure‑production scripts for papers  
- End‑to‑end data reduction or modeling  

Keeping those separate helps maintain clarity and reproducibility.

I will kepp updating once I start building!
